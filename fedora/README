CONTENT OF THIS DIRECTORY
=========================

bluez/
        - Based on Fedora official packaging. Adds items not included in
          official Fedora packages.

btts/
        - Packaging of btts itself.

*.rpmbuild.sh
        - rpmbuild based scripts to build the respective packages. Result is
          placed under the rpmbuild directory.

rpmbuild/
        - Directory used for building packages (inst. of the usual ~/rpmbuild).
          The *.rpmbuild.sh helper scripts instruct rpmbuild to use this
          directory.

rebuildall.sh
        - Script to automatically (re)build all packages

createrepo.sh
        - Script to yumify rpmbuild/RPMS directory - this can be then
          registered as a custom yum repository. Automatically invoked by
          rebuildall.sh.

reinstallall.sh
        - Script to automatically (re)install all packages. It installs from a
          yum repository named 'btts-local' (previously created and registered
          with createrepo.sh.)

clean.sh
        - Script to clean built packages and intermediate files.
