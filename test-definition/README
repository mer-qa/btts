Semi-automatic test cases whose main purpose is to serve as a draft for later
fully-automatic implementation in a way recognized by the selected Test
Executor.

This directory contains a decomposed Test Definition XML document:

    - btts.xml      Root document (the Test Definition XML root node)
    - btts-s-*.xml  One document per test-set (the <set> node)
    - btts-t-*.xml  One document per test-case (the <case> node)

To simply run a test-case with testrunner-lite, use:

    $ make run
    (You will be prompted to select the test case to be run)

To produce the composed Test Definition XML document, use:

    $ make OUTPUT=filename.xml
    (OUTPUT defaults to "tests.xml" when omitted)

In addition to the decomposition these are the differencies from valid Test
Definition XML:

    - //case/@manual is forced to "true"
    - //set/pre_steps/@manual, which is not allowed by the Test Definition
      XML, is emulated and forced to "true"
