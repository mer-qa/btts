        Test OPP "put" from the phone to the other device.
    </description>

    <step>
        BTTS: Ensure a test object (a file) is available on the phone. It
        should be big enought to guarantee a useful transfer time.
    </step>
    <step>
        PHONE: "put" a file to the btts node device.
    </step>
    <step manual="false">
        bttsr --expect "true" opp-server expect-auth-state "in-progress"
    </step>
    <step manual="false">
        bttsr opp-server auth-accept
    </step>
    <step manual="false">
        bttsr --expect "true" opp-server expect-auth-state "accepted"
    </step>
    <step manual="false">
        bttsr --expect "true" opp-server expect-xfer-state "in-progress"
    </step>
    <step>
        PHONE: Verify a file transfer and its progress is being reported
    </step>
    <step manual="false">
        bttsr --expect "true" opp-server expect-xfer-state "finished"
    </step>
    <step>
        PHONE: Verify a successful end of file transfer has been reported
    </step>
    <step>
        BTTS: Verify the file has NOT been corrupted during the transfer

        E.g. verify its checksum, which can be computed with:

            bttsr opp-server sha1
    </step>
</case>
